In this project we use Grasshopper to develop forms, I have tried to model agents' movement in a vector field â€“ I use points which I run curves through.

I have based my script on this [tutorial](https://generativelandscapes.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/agents-steered-by-a-vector-field-example-11-1/) from the blog [Generative Landscapes](https://generativelandscapes.wordpress.com/). I have yet to decide if the lines represent a structure or movement.
