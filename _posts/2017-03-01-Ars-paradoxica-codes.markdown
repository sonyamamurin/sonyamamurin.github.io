I listen to the beautiful audiodrama [Ars Paradoxica](https://arsparadoxica.com/) which features a series of numbers read at the end of each episode. I put together a spreadsheet to decipher these, [take a look if you'd like](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2tXvxwR4-Oumgf3H3ucRDdE90pUqfZpS65uwsC1dpw/edit?usp=sharing).

The cipher's used are [Vigen√©re](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/vigenere.php), [Caesarian shift](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/caesar.php) and [Atbash](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/atbash.php).
