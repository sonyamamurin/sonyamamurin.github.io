# Anton Tetov Portfolio

This is a site for my portfolio. It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

I use a [gulp workflow](gulpfile.js) to reduce css and [Anatol Broder's Jekyll layout](http://jch.penibelst.de/) to minimize HTML.

`gulp css && bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`

## TODO
*   ~~Insert actual projects~~ Insert more actual projects
*   Figure out how to deal with displaying hi res images, lightbox? Like flexbox?
