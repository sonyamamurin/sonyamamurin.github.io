# Anton Tetov Portfolio

My theme and webpage, the theme is released under MIT or GPL3, haven't taken time to decide which yet.

`gulp css && bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`

## TODO
*   ~~Insert actual projects~~ Insert more actual projects
*   Figure out how to deal with displaying hi res images, lightbox? Like flexbox?
