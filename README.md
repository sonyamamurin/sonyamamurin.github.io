# Anton Tetov Portfolio

This is a site for my portfolio. Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap for Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass).

I use a [gulp workflow](gulpfile.js) to optimize css and [Anatol Broder's Jekyll layout](http://jch.penibelst.de/) to minimize HTML.

## Set up environment
`bundle install && npm install`

## Build
`gulp`
